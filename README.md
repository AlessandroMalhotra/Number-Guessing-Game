# Number guessing game 
  The user is prompted with a welcome message and then asked to enter a number between 1 and 10.
  
  The game then starts and tells the user whether the number they inputted is in fact equal to, lower or higher to the number generated.
  
  If the user inputs a number and it is higher than the target they will be prompted with "It's lower" and if it is lower they will be prompted with "It's higher".
  
  When the user eventually guesses the correct number they will be shown a well done message and the number of attempts it took.
  
  They will then be asked if they would like to play again.
